Recursion Examples written in C++ By Corbin Stripling

Product generated to fulfill Oregon State CS coursework requirements. The program was designed to show my understanding of simple uses for recursion. I prefer the C++ vector over arrays, but vectors were not allowed in this assignment. I am comfortable with both dynamic and static arrays, but why reinvent the wheel if C++ STL already has a dynamic data structure in place.

This was writen in VIM using Red Hat Linux command line interface.

Showcased C++ skills:

Memory Management
Object Oriented Design
Recursion Applications
