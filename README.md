# recursionexample
Product generated to fulfill Oregon State CS coursework requirements. The program was designed to show my understanding of simple uses for recursion. I prefer the C++ vector over arrays, but vectors were not allowed in this assignment. I am comfortable with both dynamic and static arrays, but why reinvent the wheel if C++ STL already has a dynamic data structure in place.
